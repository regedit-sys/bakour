# BakoUR

My personal Pacman repository!

Go ahead and run
```
gpg --recv-keys A2E34CB402C2F8C65FACD5294BBE9313EA9FD27A
```
in your terminal to recieve my GPG Signing Key!

Now add the pacman repo by putting
```
[bakour]
Server = https://regedit-sys.github.io/bakour/x86_64
```
in your /etc/pacman.conf file.

Check out https://regedit-sys.github.io/bakour/available.md for packages that I've made avaliable through this!
